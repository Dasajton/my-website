## Why a Personal Website?

As a web developer, having your own website is more than just a digital business card. It's a living project that showcases your skills — and a playground for new technologies at the same time.

## The Tech Stack

I chose a modern stack for this website:

- **Next.js** with App Router for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TailwindCSS v4** for fast, consistent styling
- **ShadCN/ui** as a component library with a clean design
- **MDX** for blog articles and project descriptions
- **next-intl** for internationalization (German + English)

## Architecture Decisions

### Content as MDX

Instead of using a headless CMS, all content lives as MDX files directly in the repository. This has several advantages:

- Version control via Git
- No external service required
- Full control over rendering
- React components usable directly in Markdown

### Internationalization

With `next-intl` and the `[locale]` segment in the App Router, multilingual support can be implemented elegantly. UI texts come from JSON files, while content is maintained as separate MDX files per language.

```tsx
// Example: Using translations
const t = useTranslations("nav");
return <Link href="/projects">{t("projects")}</Link>;
```

## Code Highlighting

Blog articles support syntax highlighting with `rehype-pretty-code` and `shiki`. Here's an example:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Deployment

The website runs as a Docker container on a VPS with Caddy as a reverse proxy. With GitHub Actions, every push to `main` automatically triggers a build and deployment.

## Conclusion

The stack has proven itself: Next.js delivers excellent performance, TailwindCSS speeds up styling enormously, and MDX gives me the flexibility I need for blog posts and projects.
