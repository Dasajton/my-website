## About the Project

Physique Tracker is a web app that helps athletes and fitness enthusiasts document and analyze their bulking or cutting phases in a structured way.

## The Problem

In fitness, the changes you see in the mirror are often the most important indicators of progress — but without a system, it's easy to lose track. Photos end up scattered across your gallery, weight data in random notes, and body measurements get lost entirely.

## The Solution

Physique Tracker keeps everything in one place:

- **Regular Check-Ins** — Log weight and body measurements at defined intervals
- **Photo Uploads** — Upload weekly photos in various poses
- **Photo Comparison** — Compare photos from different weeks side by side
- **Dashboard** — Weight trends, body measurement changes and percentage development at a glance
- **Charts** — Visual progress tracking with interactive diagrams

## Features

- User registration and personal accounts
- Weekly check-ins with weight and body measurements
- Photo uploads in selectable poses
- Direct photo comparison between check-ins
- Dashboard with weight charts and percentage changes
- Installable as PWA on desktop, tablet and smartphone
- Usable in the browser or as an installed app

## Install as App

Physique Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) — meaning you can install it directly on your smartphone and use it just like a native app, no app store required.

### iPhone / iPad (Safari)

1. Open **Safari** and navigate to [physique-tracker.davidsajitz.de](https://physique-tracker.davidsajitz.de)
2. Tap the **Share button** (the square with an upward arrow) in the bottom menu bar
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Optionally customize the name, then tap **"Add"**

> **Important:** Installation only works via Safari. Other browsers like Chrome or Firefox do not support PWA installation on iOS.

### Android (Chrome)

1. Open **Google Chrome** and navigate to [physique-tracker.davidsajitz.de](https://physique-tracker.davidsajitz.de)
2. Tap the **three-dot menu** (⋮) in the top right corner
3. Select **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"**
4. Confirm by tapping **"Install"**

> **Tip:** After installation, the app appears on your home screen and opens in its own window — no browser bar, just like a native app.
