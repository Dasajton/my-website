## About the Project

Physique Tracker is a web app that helps athletes and fitness enthusiasts document and analyze their bulking or cutting phases in a structured way.

## The Problem

In fitness, the changes you see in the mirror are often the most important indicators of progress — but without a system, it's easy to lose track. Photos end up scattered across your gallery, weight data in random notes, and body measurements get lost entirely.

## The Solution

Physique Tracker keeps everything in one place:

- **Regular Check-Ins** — Log weight and body measurements at defined intervals
- **Photo Uploads** — Upload weekly photos in various poses
- **Photo Comparison** — Compare photos from different weeks side by side
- **Dashboard** — Weight trends, body measurement changes and percentage development at a glance
- **Charts** — Visual progress tracking with interactive diagrams

## Features

- User registration and personal accounts
- Weekly check-ins with weight and body measurements
- Photo uploads in selectable poses
- Direct photo comparison between check-ins
- Dashboard with weight charts and percentage changes
- Installable as PWA on desktop, tablet and smartphone
- Usable in the browser or as an installed app
